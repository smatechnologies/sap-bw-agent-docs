# Upgrade installation

With Release 16.1, the SAP BW LSAM was converted to 64-bit from 32-bit. To upgrade to the 64-bit version while maintaining the previous installation location, the 32-bit version LSAM must be uninstalled before installing the 64-bit version LSAM Alternatively, the 64-bit version can be installed to a new location and the 32-bit version will not be impacted.

:::danger
As of Release 19.1.0, the SAP BW LSAM will now act as an SAP BW system proxy. Before 19.1.0, this SAP BW proxy functionality was available in the OpCon server. Now, the OpCon server will no longer provide this functionality.

Customers who run an SAP BW LSAM must upgrade their LSAMs to 19.1.0 (when installing OpCon 19.1.0) so that the SAP BW proxy functionality will be available to them.
:::

:::caution
Before proceeding, check the services settings for "Log on as" in the service's properties. If any of the services log on as a domain user with password, make sure you have the password before proceeding with the upgrade. If multiple instances of the LSAM are installed on the machine, be sure to note this information for every instance.
